I'm a mid-career enginering professional pivoting into technology. 

With well-rounded skills in analyzing complex processes and systems, collaborating and communicating effectively in 
cross-functional teams, and understanding client needs and translating them into customized solutions, I look forward 
to playing a part in the process of developing and integrating software into a business workflow.

With a global and multicultural perspective at the intersection of technology and engineering, I have a strong motivation 
to grow and excel by building upon the foundations of C#, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL and Git. 

At this time, the repositories you find in my GitHub site are a selection of assigments from the EDGE UP 2.0 training program 
in software development completed in December 2021. (https://edgeupyyc.com/)

In 2022, my learnign journey has continued with AWS Cloud Technical Essentials. I'm also planning to learn:

-ASP.NET Core
-NoSQL (MongoDB, DynamoDB)
